      "analysis": "“United” (联合的) 强调两个或多个个体在目标、情感或组织上的结合，但不特指婚姻关系。例如 “united in purpose”（目标一致）。而 “married” 专指法律和情感上的配偶关系，具有明确的社会和法律含义。"
    },

      "word_to_compare": "engaged",
      "analysis": "“Engaged” (订婚的) 指双方已承诺将要结婚，但尚未完成婚姻仪式，属于婚前阶段。而 “married” 表示婚姻关系已经正式成立，法律和社交义务均已生效。两者在时间阶段和法律效力上有本质区别。"
